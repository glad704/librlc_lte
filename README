This is a LTE RLC implementation which aligns to 3GPP spec 36.322-930. It aims to be a high quality and high performance RLC library and as well as can be easily integrated into your code. For bit field cause, now this code can only be run perfectly on Big-Endian platform. 

To run demo, just type "make" and run "rlc_example".

Have fun!
